# fritz2
A prove of concept for an extemly lightweight reactive ui-library / framework in Kotlin heavily depending on coroutines and flows.

## How to try it that early?
Just checkout the project, import in your favourite IDE (or whatever you like), run gradle run and enjoy. Have a look at demo.kt.
But don't be too diappointed. There is not too much ready yet.

## What is there already?

- reactive one-way-Databinding
- first few HTML-elements (div, button)
- first attributes
- first event-handlers (onClick) (with ugly syntax, though)


## What will come next?



## Were is this going?
